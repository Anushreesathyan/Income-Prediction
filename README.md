# Income-Prediction
The objective of this machine learning task is to construct a predictive model for classifying individuals based on whether their income exceeds a specified threshold of $50,000. The goal is to leverage this information to create a classification model that effectively discerns between individuals with incomes above and below the $50,000 limit.
